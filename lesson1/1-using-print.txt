the print function will be your best friend when debugging

for future reference, when ever i write a ">>>" it means the
test after it i want you to type into the interpreter

in the interpreter type

>>> print 10

now try a string

string are delimited by ' or ", either one

>>> print 'hello world'
>>> print "hello world"

try these 2

>>> print '"hello world"'
>>> print "'hello world"'


actually in the interpreter if you want to print out something just do this

>>> 10
>>> "hello world"
