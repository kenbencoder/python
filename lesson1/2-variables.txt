variables are how we can store and refer to values

now remember, variables are only REFERENCES to values

we will only deal with numbers and strings

in the interactive interpreter type

>>> a = 10
>>> a

that should print 10

now do this

>>> b = a
>>> b = 20

guess what will be printed if you type

>>> a
>>> b


as with numbers, we will do with strings as well

>>> s = "ken the coder"
>>> s

>>> other = s
>>> other
>>> other = "kenbencoder"

>>> s
>>> other


ok, thats it for this lesson.
play around with print and variables for a bit
