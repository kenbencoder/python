raw_input is how we can get input from the user
it is a built in function in python so there is no
need to import anything

it takes a single argument which is the string to
prompt the user

fire up the interpreter and type

>>> raw_input('what is your name: ')

enter you name and you will find it prints out what you entered

now try

>>> myVar = raw_input('what is your name: )

this time it doesn't echo your input, it puts it into the variable myVar

now type

>>> myVar

that should print out what you entered.

thats how you can get user input :)
