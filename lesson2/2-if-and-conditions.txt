now it's time to have a bit of fun with conditions

conditions are constructed like this

if <condition>:

the keyword 'if' followed by a condition and ending with ':'

create new a python file, condition.py for example

in there, get the user input and store it in a variable called
myName. (remember how to use raw_input?)

now you can use myName to conditionally print something out
based on what name was entered

if myName == 'Ben':
	print('hello 'Ben') # remember to use tabs to indent


you can try anything

if myName == 'Ken':
	print('hello Ken')


if myName == 'Bill':
	print('you are not Ken')
	print('or Ben)

try other conditions, apart from == there is also !=
