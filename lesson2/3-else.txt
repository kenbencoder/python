what would if be without else!

else always follow an if

condition = True

if condition:
	print 'It's true!'
else:
	print 'It's false!'


and we can do it with input

my_input = raw_input('enter text: ')
if my_input == 'i am Ken':
	print 'Hi Ken!'
else:
	print 'I don't understand!'

try out some stuff with the if/else and raw_input
this is where you can try some dynamic programs :)
